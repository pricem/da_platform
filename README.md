# "Samoyed" digital audio platform for DIY

This is a set of PCB designs, FPGA firmware, and software for a digital audio interface.  The designs allow for up to 32 channels of audio I/O from four ADC/DAC modules per chassis.  The intent is to provide audio quality suitable for hi-fi systems, and to allow experimentation with ADC/DAC module design, digital filtering, and user interfaces.

Further documentation is in progress.  If you have any questions, please contact the author by creating an issue.
