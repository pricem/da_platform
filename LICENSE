Licensing specifications for DA Platform project

This open source project includes both hardware and software components.
There is no single license ideally suited to both types of design information.
Thus this project uses a split-license approach:

* Hardware components (including PCB designs and HDL code for use in an FPGA) 
  are provided under the Solderpad Hardware License, version 0.51.
  Please refer to docs/licenses/LICENSE-SHL for the complete terms.

* The software components (including scripts, C/C++, and Python
  code) are licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3.
  Please refer to docs/licenses/LICENSE-GPL for the complete terms.
