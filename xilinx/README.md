## Xilinx Vivado scripts for DA platform

The baseline platform uses a ZTEX USB-FPGA 2.13a module on the carrier card (along with a Raspberry Pi).  This module contains a Xilinx Artix-7 (XC7A35T) FPGA.  This directory contains scripts to prepare a bitstream configuring the FPGA.  The bitstream is stored in flash memory on the FPGA module and loaded at startup.  You can also run a simulation of the testbench within Vivado.
