CDP PCB errata (version 1 from 2009)

Regulators
----------
Both positive and negative 15 V regs have LM329 backwards
Negative reg has missing connection between R6 and R7
Positive regulator can't be used for +5 V supply with its 6.9 V reference 
	(have to use LDO version for this application)
Maybe these regulators could all be built using the same PCB layout and different stuffing?
R7 on LDO is too large, 475 ohms works (was 1k)
PCBs are too tall I think
Mechanical alignment/stability is not very good with 3 pin male/female headers

Isolator
--------
FX2 connector is rotated 180 deg, most likely
No debug headers for logic analyzer, SMAs or test points for scope
Prefer other types of connectors to Fastons for power/ground input
Needs to be a 4 layer board
No mounting holes
Slot 0 PCB collides with socket for clock oscillator
Why separate SPI ports for DACs and ADCs?
SPI CS muxing is annoying due to the delays that it causes
AGND and DGND are isolated, but clock select circuitry crosses boundary without isolator
	Hack of adding 10 ohm resistor between input terminals worked for now
Clock oscillators use AGND (is this right?)
Sense of ADG1436 is reversed (e.g. CLK0 and CLK1 swapped) - easy workaround

Modules
-------
I/V stage - op amp should be marked NE5534 (unless there is a good reason for something else)
I/V is biased for opposite of actual DSD1792 current; change balancing CS resistors top/bottom
I/V output follower biased too hot - increase CS resistors from 47.5 to 82.5 (20 mA to 12 mA)
I/V has no lowpass filter, and way too much bandwidth (>1 MHz)
	Add 1 nF cap across IV resistor to limit bandwidth to ~200 kHz, but this causes DC offset?
	Also consider making a real antialiasing filter (TI has 2.2 nF across same 750 ohm, plus)
DAC board should probably have balanced to unbalanced converter

General
-------
There needs to be a PCB for the power supply (the unregulated one with rectifiers and caps)
	with one multi-conductor cable from it to the isolator PCB
Need ECC for audio data - really do not want corruption for any reason
