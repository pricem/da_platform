XMOS processor
2 channel DACs only; this board is assembled in a chassis with other I2S DAC modules
Includes I2S isolator but some report better sound without it

Atmel AVR32 processor
Built all in one USB DAC boards, various DAC chips including ES9023 and PCM5102 have been used
Has now evolved into a product: Henry Audio USB DAC 128 mkII (AK4430)
Previous: QNKTC AB-1.0, AB-1.1, AB-1.2

Good collaboration between several people experimenting with different aspects of the project (DAC, power supply, etc.)
    and thinking about the packaging/marketing options and cost issues (i.e. how many boards needed?)

Borge was very dedicated in tracking down and fixing problems in the firmware, e.g. occasional noises at different sample rates
    and when the host is under load.


- Exa U2I?

Looks commercial.   http://www.exadevices.com/
It looks like this is a startup company founded after the DIYaudio project.  Nice.
They got good ratings in Stereophile.  D28 DAC sells for $3300.

I guess I wouldn't have heard about this since it was started in 2011.
Uses FPGA - any more details?


Many people used this I2S interface in conjunction with Twisted Pear Audio Buffalo DACs
But it was rumored that TPA was making their own I2S interface and saw this as a competitor
    As of 2016, it looks like TPA resells the Amanero I2S interface: http://amanero.com/
    There is a Xilinx chip on there... for what?  The schematic doesn't show it
    USB is handled by Atmel microcontroller
    2-channel only
So the interactions between Exa and TPA were interesting
    Note: TPA is Brian Donegan and Russ White of West Newbury, MA (between Haverhill and Newburyport)
    
Around the beginning of 2012 they offered to develop a revised version of the U2I board for DIYers, then withdrew.
Around the beginning of 2014 they did another manufacturing run of U2I boards and then stopped.

Favorite quote (tsiros #1161): "there is no facepalm big enough. "


- Async I2S FIFO

iancanada develops his own FIFO platform with Altera FPGA and an SRAM chip?
    This guy is incredibly thoughtful, and generous (losing money on the group buy, adding features based on 1 request)
    Also a very good PCB designer and assembler.

The concept is that it is I2S (or SPDIF) input, to connect to an existing CD player type transport.
    The problem is that there is no feedback for input rate, so there can be a clock frequency difference between the source and FIFO
    But at 100ppm, it will take a long time to underflow/overflow if it's filled halfway at start

Also, a guy named simmconn chipped in to show a custom board he had made with Spartan-3: DAKS (Digital Audio Kitchen Sink)

Another guy Steve Nugent. (audioengr; nugent@empiricalaudio.com) says he designed his own in port #57
He called it the Pacecar
He also mentioned the Genesis Digital Lens

simmconn raises concerns about using a relay to switch between the 44.1/48 multiple clocks  - #61
    Clock switching and distribution needs be thought about, especially for driving a variable number of loads.

Demian Martin (1audio) #68: suggests phase noise matters between 10 Hz to 200 kHz
    AES only cares down to 100 Hz but he's suspicious of the impact on audibility
    Switching oscillators on/off frequently may hurt performance

In post #100, Ian resigns himself to running 2 XOs at the same time, using U.FL to connect clocks.

Jonathan Carr points out a similar effort in Japanese in post #103

Technical docs on post #248 (24 Feb 2012)

Also, Demian has a regulator design specific to XO power supply (focused on noise, not output impedance).  Worth looking into.

Fun random post: "Egad! Intra-Oz flaming. "

Some discussion around pg 36--40 about making it handle different non-I2S DACs with its output format

Post #505 (14 May 2012) shows integration with Buffalo III

Some discussion about clock selection   
    Generic choice seems to by Crystek CCHD something
    But Ian also did some experiments with the Si570 programmable synthesizer, and this site shows good performance:
        http://www.cliftonlaboratories.com/si570_kit_from_k5bcq.htm
        Si570 is also less expensive, but more power-hungry (100 mA) and poor PSRR
    Might be interesting to figure out a measurement setup for clock jitter (requires ref. source close to test frequency, and mixer)
