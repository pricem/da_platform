CDP work planning - Summer 2013

Get PMOD DAC working over USB - drive headphones

Get full complement of regulators working - +/- 15, +5, +3.3D, +3.3A

--------

Goals for initial stereo:
- Support 3 synchronized 2-ch DAC cards, or just 1 (i.e. allow digital/analog crossover comparison)
- Allow DAC board revision for good fidelity (i.e. FPGA interface not the limiting factor)
- Allow packaging up cleanly (e.g. ribbon cables to power supply) - PCB for power supply stuff would be good
- Allow development of other DAC/ADC modules and firmware support
- Reliable enough to connect to amp inputs directly - test various contingencies
- Rudimentary SW (streaming controlled over SSH from laptop?)

Plan for what to get done with FPGA before next HW revision:
- Get 2-channel loopback working
    - Add "read audio" command/response
    - Add playback/recording blocking register that is atomically updated for all slots
- Measure audio performance of current 2-ch DAC/IV stage
- Figure out what was wrong
- Try out 8-ch ADC and DAC to see what insights can be learned



Next revision ideas below:

a) Software/host

Once USB I/O via Python script is going:
Goal is to have a streaming box with the following capabilities:
- Play CD/DVD/BD from attached drive
- Play Netflix or other online streaming (HDMI out for video)
- Play WAV or other audio format hosted on another computer (Ethernet/Wifi)
- Remote control via a tablet ("casting"?)

Vague plan for achieving this goal:
- Get a small/cheap Linux PC with HDMI/USB, and a cheap Android tablet
- Figure out how to to get the PC to do what the tablet tells it to do

Stretch goal:
- Add Windows / Mac support so it can be used like a normal USB sound card (audio class driver?)


b) Hardware

First HW rev will not include PC in same chassis.  Just a USB soundcard.

PCB redesign ideas:
- Consider all errata from first rev.
- Include regs onboard?
- Include footprint for ZTEX FPGA board and JTAG connector.  Supply power to the FPGA.
- Have plug-in cards be horizontal with two 0.1" headers for better mechanical contact.  Space is cheap.
- Use coax/twisted-pair to I/O RCA and XLR connectors, or figure out some other cabling.
- Improve clock buffering/distribution.  Experiment: SMA vs. LVDS-over-PCB e.g. FIN1001 / FIN1002 (ADI has a TX: ADN4661)
- Add Logicport debug connector
- Come up with some way to allow different clocks (e.g. Tentlabs vs. Crystek vs. other)
