CDP work planning notes

Summer 2013
-----------
Get PMOD DAC working over USB - drive headphones

Get full complement of regulators working - +/- 15, +5, +3.3D, +3.3A
[continued... in hindsight, looks like I got DAC2 board running off Nexys2 and isolator, without DRAM FIFO, and one channel of I/V]

Aug 2016
--------

a) Hardware roadmap
0.  ZTEX board with empty debug board - test USB interface and DRAM FIFO
    -> Finished, sometime in early Aug 2016
1.  ZTEX board with debug board wired up to FPGA adapter
    -> Finished; got basic functionality on 8/12/2016, error-free I2S loopback and 2-ch DAC analog out on 1/2/2017
2.  New FPGA adapter board which acts as carrier for ZTEX board
    -> Skipping ahead to final board, will use a sandwich adapter for testing with existing DAC/ADC
3.  "Final" board with new DAC/ADC spec - FPGA TBD
    Needs to consider mechanicals, cost, PC integration
    -> This is current task as of March 2017; planning to continue using ZTEX board, with USBStreamer/Ministreamer as lower cost alternative

Goals for initial stereo:
- Support 3 synchronized 2-ch DAC cards, or just 1 (i.e. allow digital/analog crossover comparison)
- Allow DAC board revision for good fidelity (i.e. FPGA interface not the limiting factor)
- Allow packaging up cleanly (e.g. ribbon cables to power supply) - PCB for power supply stuff would be good
- Allow development of other DAC/ADC modules and firmware support
- Reliable enough to connect to amp inputs directly - test various contingencies
- Rudimentary SW (streaming controlled over SSH from laptop?)

Plan for what to get done with FPGA before next HW revision:
- Get 2-channel loopback working
    - Add "read audio" command/response
    - Add playback/recording blocking register that is atomically updated for all slots
- Measure audio performance of current 2-ch DAC/IV stage
- Figure out what was wrong
- Try out 8-ch ADC and DAC to see what insights can be learned



Next revision ideas below:

a) Software/host

Once USB I/O via Python script is going:
Goal is to have a streaming box with the following capabilities:
- Play CD/DVD/BD from attached drive
- Play Netflix or other online streaming (HDMI out for video)
- Play WAV or other audio format hosted on another computer (Ethernet/Wifi)
- Remote control via a tablet ("casting"?)

Vague plan for achieving this goal:
- Get a small/cheap Linux PC with HDMI/USB, and a cheap Android tablet
- Figure out how to to get the PC to do what the tablet tells it to do

Stretch goal:
- Add Windows / Mac support so it can be used like a normal USB sound card (audio class driver?)


b) Hardware

First HW rev will not include PC in same chassis.  Just a USB soundcard.
->> Change 1/15/2017: Include footprint for a Raspberry Pi. (Model B+ ver 3)
    To be used as streaming server (mpd)

PCB redesign ideas:
- Consider all errata from first rev.
- Include regs onboard?
- Include footprint for ZTEX FPGA board and JTAG connector.  Supply power to the FPGA.
- Have plug-in cards be horizontal with two 0.1" headers for better mechanical contact.  Space is cheap.
- Use coax/twisted-pair to I/O RCA and XLR connectors, or figure out some other cabling.
- Improve clock buffering/distribution.  Experiment: SMA vs. LVDS-over-PCB e.g. FIN1001 / FIN1002 (ADI has a TX: ADN4661)
- Add Logicport debug connector
- Come up with some way to allow different clocks (e.g. Tentlabs vs. Crystek vs. other)

Mar 2017

Planning v2 hardware setup
Goals
    Maintain stuffing options for cheaper versions and alternate USB interfaces
    
Order of operations plan
    DONE Chassis mechanical design and PCB floorplanning: roughly know the specs of everything and check feasibility
    DONE Unreg PSU board design/ordering--get more transformers, wall wart and input connectors etc. along with it
    DONE Plywood chassis/wiring checks with PSU
    Clock dist prototyping
        DONE Design/order clock board and a mating diff-SE board (SMAs out) with long traces (and headers?)
        DONE Verify functionality with clock and PSU PCBs, in LVDS and CML modes (+ all combinations)
        Stretch goal: check phase noise of each oscillator option before/after the link
    Supply regulator prototyping (before including supplies on underside of isolator)
        DONE Design/order reg board with +/- 15, A5, D3.3 outputs
        DONE Measurements: noise spectra, output impedance, Jung and 3-terminal variants
    Carrier prototyping
        DONE Design/order carrier A board, check that it can work with v1 isolator
        POSTPONED Design/order carrier B board, USB/mini-streamers, check that they can work with v1 isolator
    Then add isolator and chassis
    Then design new modules
        Additional idea: expand carrier with Bluetooth and SPDIF inputs 
    And of course, work on software
