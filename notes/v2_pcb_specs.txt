Specs for things to include on v2 PCBs
=========================================


PSU
---
Lowest reverse-recovery diodes possible
    Why not Schottkys?
12-pin connector to isolator

Carrier (shared)
----------------

Footprint for upside down RPi
JST power connector for 5 V (probably from ext wall wart)

Carrier option A - ZTEX FPGA
---------
FPGA board footprint (no mounting holes)
JTAG connector

Carrier option B - {USB, Mini}streamer
---------
Mechanical scheme for mounting streamer board
Header for attaching streamer board connections (put streamer upside down?)

Isolator
--------

Stuffing option for resistors instead of ADUM isolators
Debug header that is outside shadow of carrier


Jung discrete regs under center of board
Stuffing option for low cost 3 terminal regs for +/- 15, 5, 3.3 V

Clock
-----
Clock source support (stuffing options):
    Crystek CCHD-957
    Tentlabs XO
    Some other decent inexpensive osc.
    SMA input (SE CMOS level), as if from an arrogant module
Differential driver support:
    LVDS - low cost
        FIN1001 type driver
    CML - high performance
        ADCLK948 driver
        AD9515 receiver
Debug connections for:
    Clock sources - SMA
    Clock select input

Series resistance for CMOS clock outputs (10 to 22 ohm?)
Good supply decoupling / ferrite beads
Stuffing option for local supply regulation

    

Modules
--------
Module adapter for testing v1 modules before v2 modules are designed
