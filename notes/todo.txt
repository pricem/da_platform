DA platform to-do

Sep 21, 2014

- Fix errors in CellRAM sim

- Create behavioral model of FPGALink so that it's easy to test 
  by supplying an input data file on the command line
  (contents of this file should be relayed over USB)

- Create a basic read/write test of CellRAM
  (command can either read or write variable number of bytes)
    - Get working in simulation
    - Get working on Nexys2



Jan 18, 2015
- Received ZTEX USB-FPGA Module 2.13a (FPGA board with Artix-7)
- Switching from earlier CellRAM/Nexys2 to [DDR3] DRAM and Xilinx MIG

Mar 1, 2015
- Earlier demonstrated FIFO app using ZTEX board
- Currently working on test of DRAM based FIFO arbitrator

No easy way to simulate the memory
- Micron provides a plain Verilog model of DDR3 chips, but
- Xilinx MIG requires Xilinx encrypted primitives
--> Do most design work with a MIG model, and use VCS once it's working to simulate the full system
