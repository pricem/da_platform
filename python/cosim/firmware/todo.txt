Todo list

Make and test general simultaneous reads/writes with memory arbitrator
-   Update fake generic DAC and ADC modules to actually consume / produce data

Check operation of FX2 interface (note that FX2 model on laptop may not use all endpoints)

Add converter interface module for PMOD-DA2 and determine if anything architectural needs changing
-   Base module to handle adjustable bit rates and justification and serialize data?

Add ability for memory arbitrator to reinitialize reads/writes at the end of a cell RAM row
-   Keep track of current cell RAM address; when it reaches a multiple of 128, update the start
    address and return to initializing cycle state

Add configurable behavior to cell RAM


Make memory arbitrator capable of handling reads/writes down to 1 byte[?]
-   Properly handle upper/lower byte issues
-   Reduce min_chunk to 1 and adjust timings for correctness
-   Is this really necessary?  (If you stop playing audio, do you care if it stops 1 sample short?)
    Yes, but defer to later
