Check operation of FX2 interface (note that FX2 model on laptop may not use all endpoints)
Add converter interface module for PMOD-DA2 and determine if anything architectural needs changing
Add ability for memory arbitrator to reinitialize reads/writes at the end of a cell RAM row
Add configurable behavior to cell RAM
