List of control transfer types

Program flow:
    Software configuration
    -> Converter register values
    -> I/O module register values
    -> HWCON values
    

Control transfers may be sent to or from the FPGA over USB.  Direction choices are:
    - I: In, from the FPGA to the computer
    - O: Out, from the computer to the FPGA
    - I/O: Either direction

Control transfers are each designated by a 1-byte code:
    - The first bit determines whether action is requested:
      Commands have codes starting with 0 (0x00 - 0x7F)
      Status/informational packets start with 1 (0x80 - 0xFF)

Packet format:
    Byte 0: header byte (0xFF default)
    Byte 1: transfer type (0x00 - 0xFF)
    Bytes [3:2]: length N in bytes
    Bytes 4 to N+3: data
